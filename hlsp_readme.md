General Information
-------------------
NASA's *Kepler* primary mission observed about 116 deg2 in the sky for 3.5 consecutive years to discover Earth-like exoplanets.
This mission recorded pixel cutouts, known as Target Pixel Files (TPFs), of over $200,000$ targets selected to maximize the scientific yield.
The Kepler pipeline performed aperture photometry for these primary targets to create light curves.
However, hundreds of thousands of background sources were recorded in the TPFs and have never been systematically analyzed.
This work uses the Linearized Field Deblending (LFD) method, a Point Spread Function (PSF) photometry algorithm, to extract light curves.
We use Gaia DR3 as input catalog to extract 606,900 light curves from long-cadence TPFs.
406,548 are new light curves of background sources, while the rest are Kepler's targets.
These light curves have comparable quality as those computed by the Kepler pipeline, with CDPP values $<100$ ppm for sources $G<16$.
The light curve files are available as high-level science products at MAST.
Files include PSF and aperture photometry, and extraction metrics.
Additionally, we improve the background and PSF modeling in the LFD method.
This new nearly unbiased catalog enables further studies in planet search, occurrence rates, and other time-domain studies.

A full description of this dataset can be found in Martinez-Palomera et al. 2023 [2], as well as the Python library [`psfmachine`](https://github.com/SSDataLab/psfmachine) that was used to extract the light curves. An example of the parameter configuration and how `psfmachine` was used can be found in the GitHub repository [`KBonus`](https://github.com/jorgemarpa/KBonus).


What is Being Released
----------------------
This is the v1.0 release of source light curves observed in Kepler's TPFs:

* 606,900 PSF light curve files in FITS format. Each file contain concatenated time series all detectable quarters (primary extension), and multiple extensions with the per-quarter light curves.

* **hlsp_kbonus-bkg_kepler_kepler_source-catalog_kepler_v1.0_cat.fits**: a FITS catalog containing the 606,900 Gaia DR3 objects with G<19 observed in the TPFs.

* **hlsp_kbonus-bkg_kepler_kepler_kois-nns-catalog_kepler_v1.0_cat.fits**: a FITS catalog containing the Kepler Object of Interest (KOIs) and all the neibors around each KOI within 30 arcseconds.

* **hlsp_kbonus-bkg_kepler_kois-nns_v1.0_lcf.tar.gz**: tarball files with all light curve files listed in the KOIs and neighbors catalog.

* **hlsp_kbonus-bkg_kepler_kepler_mstars-catalog_kepler_v1.0_cat.fits**: a FITS catalog containing the M-stars as described in [2].

* **hlsp_kbonus-bkg_kepler_mstars_v1.0_lcf.tar.gz**: tarball files with all light curve files listed in the M-dwarf catalog.

* **hlsp_kbonus-bkg_kepler_kepler_wd-catalog_kepler_v1.0_cat.fits**: a FITS catalog containing the white dwarfs.

* **hlsp_kbonus-bkg_kepler_wd_v1.0_lcf.tar.gz**: tarball files with all light curve files listed in the white dwarf catalog.

* this "README" file

The light curve files have names of the form:

    hlsp kbonus-bkg_kepler_kepler_<source_id>_kepler_v1.0_lc.fits

where `<source_id>` is the KIC value of the object or the Gaia DR3 source id when no KIC is available.



How the Catalogs Were Prepared
------------------------------
The KBonus-BKG uses *Kepler*'s TPFs from all 17 observation quarters. The TPFs are available at MAST archive and correspond to small cutouts (typically 5x5 pixels) around the selected *Kepler* targets.
This HLSP uses Gaia DR3 as input catalog to compile a catalog of 606,900 light curves. 406,548 correspond to **new** background sources. The rest are *Kepler* targets.
A sky map of the observed sources is shown here:

The color magnitude diagram of *Kepler* targets and new background sources follows:

Object Detection and Photometry
-------------------------------
We used the Gaia DR3 catalog [4] as input to detect sources down to 19th magnitude in the G band.
We perform PSF photometry using the Linearized Field Deblending method (LFD) [4] to compute PSF models from *Kepler*'s FFIs and evaluate it in the TPFs.
This method includes background modeling, mean PSF photometry and corrected PSF photometry. The latter accounts for velocity aberration effects and other instrument systematics.
The LFD method is implemented in the Python package *psfmachine*
